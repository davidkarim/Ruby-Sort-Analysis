<h1>Analysis of Various Sorting Algorithms in Ruby</h1>
This exercise is meant to show the coding of three sorting algorithms in Ruby and how they compare, performance-wise, to each other. The last sort performed is using the Linux command. Although still being run in Ruby, the Linux sort command is implemented via a C algorithm, making it superior to the first three implementations. These kinds of comparisons can help when determining the [big O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) of different algorithms.

This analysis was done on a Jupyter notebook and can be seen [here](sort_analysis.ipynb).
